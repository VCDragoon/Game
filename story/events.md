## d20 events

| Event | Type | Placeholder |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| Clouds of fist sized asteroids. Flying through the clouds will cause minor to moderate damage to shields and hull. The clouds vary in size from roughly that of a stunt fighter to a dreadnought.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| Spacecraft sized cloud of asteroids, slowly drifting and colliding.  The asteroids vary in size from roughly that of a stunt fighter to a blockade runner. | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| An out of orbit moon, cracked, decaying, dead and lifeless.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| A cluster of aged, defunct satellites, signal repeaters, landing assistors and other mechanical detritus. The cluster is approximately the size of a dreadnought spacecraft. Only ships light transport and smaller would be able to maneuver between the hunks of metal. | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| A spacestation, approximately the size of a dreadnought spacecraft. No lights, signals or transmissions are emitting from it. | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| An enormous asteroid, riddles with clearly visible caves and tunnels that a light transport or smaller spacecraft could easily enter and navigate. | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| Clouds of stunt fighter sized chunks of ice that will melt to water when close enough to ship exhaust and energy weapon fire.  | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| Two warp portals, apart by a distance of the length of a d10 dreadnoughts. The portals are about the width and height of a terran moon. A mass of space detritus is caught in an endless loops, warping from one portal to the other, endlessly drifting from the slight push of force the portals provide on exit. | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| An enormous stone structure cubic or pyramid in shape. It is approximately the size of a dreadnought. It is riddled with entrances, windows, clear passageways and rooms indicating it was a structure for habitation. It is ancient and rotting, also clearly not intended for space travel.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| A moon sized comet, hurtling through space with a brightly colored trail of gas and debris. Collusions with the comet would be catastrophic for most space craft. | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| An out of commission and rotting dreadnought, large holes riddling its hull. No sign of power or operation.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| Dead, hardened organic hive structure the size of a dreadnought. Chunks of rotting organic material trails behind the hive as it floats through space. It does not appear to be inhabited.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| Clouds of purple and yellow ion storming that will completely dematerialize ship shield systems. The ion storm is either one moon size cloud, or several smaller clouds over a larger area.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| Clouds of thick green gas that most rudimentary ship scanning system will indicate as extremely flammable and explosive.  The gas clouds are either one moon size cloud, or several smaller clouds over a larger area.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| Brown green clouds of thick dust, gas and pebbles. Flying through these clouds will cause almighty din in any areas of the ship close to the external hull as stones bounce from it.  May also disrupt audio visual sensors and decrease manual visibility. The clouds are either one moon size cloud, or several smaller clouds over a larger area.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| d20 Still smoldering husks of obliterated spacecraft involved in a recent battle. There does not appear to be any survivors but some ship signals are still live but silent.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| A clearly living organic structure approximately the size of a moon. May be tree/seaweed/fungus/sea cucumber/coral/etc-like in its formation.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| The putrid and disintegrating carcass of some mythical, long dead space beast. Its features are rotted beyond recognition and classification. All that is left behind is flesh, bone, ichor and organs frozen and floating in space approximately the size of a dreadnought. Frozen globules of blood approximately the size of a stunt fighter orbit the carcass.| Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| d20 unmanned, unpowered ancient stunt fighter class ships, drifting together connected by a web of fuel and powerlines. They are of a design and make not seen in eons. | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| Clusters of drifting, stunt fighter sized globules of a type of dark matter. While entering them will not cause lasting or physical damage, entering them will result in complete ship system failure. This dark matter will pass through any physical barriers (ship hulls/shields) as if the matter around the globule has absolutely no effect on it. Organic creatures will become unconscious for d10 minutes if they come into passing contact with a globule. Anything remaining in contact with the dark matter for more than a few minutes will disappear from existence. | Scenery/Obstacles/Cover | Raw (unedited) |
| The scenery, whatever it is, has clearly been nibbled/chomped/eaten by a now absent space leviathan. | Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |

|Garbled/disturbing/intruging localized transmissions | Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
|Inhabited by system specific alien menace – along with the housing required by that race. | Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| Inhabited by system specific rogue humans (rebels, pirates, anarchists, etc) - along with the housing required. | Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| Floating globules of magnetic, liquid metal. Will stick to star ships leading to unusual hull shapes and possibly loss of speed.| Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) | 
| The scenery is churning and swirling in a massive gravitational maelstrom. This maelstrom may affect the movement of star ships travelling through it.| Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| The scenery is caught in an unexplained ring of gravity. The scenery is a slowly rotating ring (like Saturn’s) missing a central mass to cause the formation.| Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| Dog sized chitinous organic life with the ability to live in the vacuum of space are thriving in the area. They are attracted to something here. | Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| Elephant sized chitinous organic life with the ability to live in the vacuum of space are thriving in the area. They are attracted to something here. | Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| The area is replete with a valuable resource that can be salvaged, mined or foraged. It may be the scenery itself, or attatched/ingrained within the scenery.| Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| Space mushrooms or truffle balls of various sizes and colours coat the physical objects in the area, or float listlessly in space. They will explode in clouds of spores when coming into contact with space craft and their engine exhaust.| Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| The area, or parts of it, emit hazardous levels of radiation that may seep through ship hulls depending on the craft.  | Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| Space miraging causes objects in the area to multiply, shimmer, blur and other wise confuse those nearby.| Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| The physical objects in the area coated in clusters of dog sized eggs. Eggs may or may not be covered in slime and goop and raised on a stalk. Obscene lifeforms may or may not be contained within.| Descriptor/mutator/weirdness | Raw (unedited) |
| d6 fleshy, multi limbed, organic star ships about the size of a stunt fighter. They look like a fleshy torpedo, with appendages and organs protruding out in all directions. They are made up of an amalgamation of vaguely human features. They have no shields or weapon systems but are very fast (use stunt fighter stats), propelled by unseen, unknown force. There fleshy, giant hand like appendages can latch onto other ships and slowly tear them apart. One of the ships will be carrying something random from Table A.  Roll on the Reaction and Action table to see what they are up to. They communicate clearly using psychic voice transmission. | Weird Entities | Raw (unedited) |
| A dreadnought sized ratty and rotting salvaged star ship. It looks like it is made up from the remains of hundreds of destroyed star ships. The salvaged ship is controlled by a self aware AI that is travelling through space to further grow itself. Roll on the Reaction and Action table to see what the ship is up to. Its constant and most pressing concern is the gathering of more scrap material to grow. Use the same stats as a Dreadnought with the following modifications: halved hitpoints and shields, weapons: 4 x Laser Cannons (4d6 ), Proton missiles X 1 (8d6), only modification is an FTL drive. | Weird Entities | Raw (unedited) |
| An ancient blockade runner sized star ship controlled by an AI (Same stats as a blockade runner, no weapons). It is a plague carrying ship, rife with a variety of diseases and viruses. Airborne contamination is constantly pumped through the air supply and many stocks of different diseases are in cyro-storage in the ships hanger.  The AI will hail and request immediate docking with any ships it encounters claiming it has gifts for those onboard. The ship was sent from a distant system on the behest an alien species that thrives in disease ridding environments. | Weird Entities | Raw (unedited) |
| An organic and sentient space station is set up in the area. It is manned by humanoid shaped drone workers devoid of features who work tirelessly to create a good from Table A. The station looks like a massive amalgamation of human internal organs. The station is also armed with d20 organic starships listed on result 1 on this table. Roll on the reaction table above to see how the sentient space station communicates physically with those it encounters. | Weird Entities | Raw (unedited) |
| Heavy transport, inhabited by d30 Myconid Walker aliens (Mushroom octopi that use mind control spores to take over hosts). The heavy transport is floating slowly, engines unpowered. The ship will hail passer byes and report in stilted, warped voices that they are having trouble piloting their craft and require assistance. The Myconid Walker’s require more hosts. If boarded the Heavy Transport is choked with spores and fungi growth. Though they want more hosts, the aliens would also appreciate knowledge on how to operate the ship… | Weird Entities | Raw (unedited) |
| A blockade runner sized space creature that resembles a mix of a bat and an eagle. It has the same stats as a blockade runner, minus shields. It manifests an energy beam from its hoary beak that does the same amount of damage as a heavy laser (6d6). It communicates physically in a shrilly manifesting voice. Roll on the reaction and action table to find out what it is up to. | Weird Entities | Raw (unedited) |

### Gravity

01-20: Pulls in the wrong direction at normal strength.

01-05: Is offset -45°. Under otherwise normal conditions, this orients to 135° (Down-Starboard.)

06-10: Is offset +45°. Under otherwise normal conditions, this orients to 225° (Down-Port.)

11-15: Is offset -20° Fore-Aft. Under otherwise normal conditions, moving towards the bow is an uphill hike.

16-20: Is offset +20° Fore-Aft. Under otherwise normal conditions, moving towards the stern is an uphill hike.

21-45: Shifts cardinally in the wrong direction, at normal strength.

21-25: Is offset -90°. Under otherwise normal conditions, this orients to 90°. The starboard wall is now the deck.

26-30: Is offset +90°. Under otherwise normal conditions, this orients to 270°. The port wall is now the deck.

31-35: Is offset 180°. Under otherwise normal conditions, this orients to 360°. The ceiling is now the deck.

36-40: Is offset -90° Fore-Aft. Under otherwise normal conditions, the aft wall is now the deck.

41-45: Is offset +90° Fore-Aft. Under otherwise normal conditions, the fore wall is now the deck.

46-80: Has strength issues.

46-55: Is between 0.5g and 0.75g. Low Gravity Modifiers (Pages 38 and 116, Core) are in effect.

56-60: Is between 0.17g and 0.25g. Triple the effects of Low Gravity.

61-70: Is between 1.5g and 2g. High Gravity Modifiers (Pages 38 and 116, Core) are in effect.

71-75: Is between 3g and 3.5g. Triple the effects of High Gravity, and this is -30 arduous terrain (Page 253, Core).

76-80: Is less than 0.08g. There is effectively no gravity whatsoever - treat as zero gravity (Pages 38 and 116, Core). This is -10 difficult terrain

81-90: Has two distinct problems. Roll twice on this chart.

91-95: Has three distinct problems. Roll thrice on this chart.

96-100: Gravity shifts frequently.

### Navigational Hazards
01-25: You Can't Get There from Here. Such is the state of the ship that, to put it quite plainly, you cannot chart anything approaching a reasonable route to your destination from your location. It might be literally separated from you by just one bulkhead, or it might be on the other side or end of the ship, but you can't get there from here. If you want to reach your destination, you must chart a circuitous or otherwise non-intuitive route. You'll get there, eventually, barring some non-euclidian geometry (which is not only possible but entirely probable on this ship,) but it will take you a while. Increase the time to arrive at your destination by 60% over what a reasonable arrival time would be. A Navigation test is called for, with each degree of success reducing the time penalty by 10%. Failures can actually increase your arrival time, as even less-efficient routes are plotted, or the navigator gets lost. But look on the bright side: anyone may treat Navigation as a Basic Skill on the Occurrence Border.

26-50: Unexpected Obstruction. Something unexpected obstructs your route. It may be that a corridor you were planning to use has been vented to space, flushed with hot plasma, or has been filled with wall-to-wall servitors. Extremely intensive maintenence may be taking place, or the ship's Armsmen may be fighting a battle with minor daemons. A hatch may have slammed shut and broken shut. Either way, delay is inevitable, whether you go through, or backtrack and go around. Barring an unusual ability to resolve the obstruction (joining the armsmen in battle, tip-toeing through the repair work, putting on voidsuits and traversing the voided corridor, etc,) a 25% increase in travel time hits you unexpectedly and unavoidably.

51-75: Gravity hazard strikes suddenly and without forewarning. Maybe the section you were attempting to traverse had an unmarked gravity anomaly, maybe it just developed, possibly while you were in the corridor. This could be dangerous, but the upshot is that it might not slow you down much, and might even give you a speed boost (if the corridor you need to traverse becomes a nice easy downhill jog,) assuming you can pass it without being injured. Roll on the Gravity Issues Table and apply the effects without warning.

76-90: Mundane Weirdness. The terrain becomes appallingly weird as you traverse the ship. You might encounter a corridor which has unexpectedly become a snowy wonderland (or an icy hellscape.) You might encounter a room where cooking grease from the ship's kitchens has gushed en masse, and then been stirred up by gravitational fluctuations, or a corridor where the hull plates are buzzing and snapping with electricity. Either way, traversing this corridor is gonna be hard.

91-100: Warpy Weirdness. If you're flying on the Occurrence Border, then Warp phenomena can become just another navigational hazard. Roll on the Warp Problems Table, re-rolling any result of 76 or greater. This is just the shit you have to deal with getting to the problem you were heading to deal with!

### Warp Issues
01-05: Chill Snap
The temperature suddenly drops, immediately and dramatically. No insulation can protect you against this effect, you immediately feel as if you were hit in the face with an arctic blast while stark naked, regardless of what you're wearing. This is literally chilling, but has no lingering effect. No thermometers will ever record this, not even those applied to your person, but you're probably going to be left with chattering teeth and rubbing yourself, or seeking a source of warmth.

06-10: Temperature Spike
The exact opposite of Chill Snap, your temperature suddenly spikes, making you feel as if you walked an hour on a blazing day. Unless you can pass an Easy (+30) Toughness test, you gain one level of Fatigue which persists until you can cool off, the most expedient way to do so being to strip and jump into the nearest shower for a few minutes.

11-15: Did you say something?
You think that someone in your group said something to you, but you didn't make it out. When you ask them to repeat it, they deny having said anything. For extra !!Fun!!, the GM might pass a note to one player, directing them to say something in-character, either addressed to another member of the group or which will undoubtedly get their interest, but to muffle it or jumble their words up, then deny ever having said anything. If you're alone, you may still hear the voice of a friend, comrade, or a loved one saying something, and it will be natural to assume they have joined you and are just behind you, but when you look, you are alone.

16-20: Phantom Movement
You can't shake the feeling that there's something out there, moving, on the edge of your peripheral vision, but when you look there is nothing except what should be there. But when you look back to what you were doing, you see it again...

20-25: Flickering Lights
The lights in the compartment flicker, and continue to do so for quite some time. You can't really be sure this is the Whispers of the Warp and not the mundane result of an old ship being shitty... But the moment you go to diagnose the fault, the lights spring back to full, and electrical sensors will register no disruption in the area.

26-30: Electrical Disruption
Like a result of Flickering Lights except moreso, an Electrical Disruption is often the bane of the ship's Mechanicus and Engineers. Things begin to malfunction in the vicinity; doors unlocking themselves and opening, latches on lockers springing open, data-panels flickering on and of, circulator fans shutting off or spinning into overdrive, recaf machines spitting out scalding-hot tea, lighting fixtures blowing out or glowing too brightly, etcetera. These faults appear to have mundane cause, but go away as soon as you begin attempting to repair them. The moment you look back to the work you were about to perform, you see that on second inspection, there is nothing wrong after all.

31-35: Ghostly Scream
An horrific scream echoes down the corridors, much like the sound of a man having his bollocks gnawed off by a Kroot Hound. When you arrive at the source of the sound, ready to render aid, you burst in upon the inhabitants of the compartment, who were going about their business and hadn't heard any screams. Of course, the one time you do decide to ignore it, it's going to have been someone actually being murdered...

36-40: Dark Forboding
A chill wind blows past everyone, chilling them slightly, even through the heaviest insulating equipment. Their temperature returns to normal, but they're unable to shake the feeling that somewhere, something dreadful has happened. The GM may want to call upon one or more of the players to deliver an Obi-Wan like declaration of what they feel has transpired... Or the players may wish to supply it themselves.

41-45: Warp Echo
For up to a minute, reverberation becomes greatly enhanced, regardless of the acoustic qualities of the environs. Loud machinery rapidly becomes an incoherent din, while voices can be hard to make out.

46-50: Temporal Echo
You come suddenly across a scene from the Occurrence Border's past. This can be subtle - for instance, seeing a few crewmen you don't recognize performing work that you think was already done ages ago - or it can be dramatic, such as seeing the events of the Chaos Incursion that lead to the Daemonic possession of the Cogtain, watching Servitors doing blasphemous things. When you attempt to interact with the echo, however, you experience a moment of sudden disorientation, and find yourself alone, with only those who should be there, wondering what just happened.

51-55: Moment of Emotion
You experience a sudden moment of intense emotion, no greater than one combat round in duration. This might be a major distraction during actual combat, but even if suddenly possessed by berzerk rage, the moment will pass before you can act on it... But you may well hang on to that feeling, if it was resonant with your true feelings. Feel free to just choose, or the GM may roll on the provided random emotion table, or choose for you.

Random Emotion Table (1d10)
1. Rage
2. Depression
3. Paranoia
4. Lust
5. Vengefulness
6. Avarice
7. Ambition
8. Sadism
9. Terror
10. Joy
11. Warp Wind

Air howls through the area, as though the compartment were exposed to the void, or the atmosphere circulation systems were overloading. Light objects like paper, recaf mugs, servo-skulls, and the like are flung around. The phenomena dies down after a few seconds, and upon investigating, no cause may be discovered, nor was the wind blast recorded by any sensors.

61-65: Mirror Ripple
Mirrors and other reflective surfaces appear to ripple, like waves on the surface of water. If they are touched, they feel solid, but appear to react much like water into which an object has been dropped.

66-70: Baleful Introspection
Your mind is drawn inexorably towards your regrets, opportunities you failed to capitalize on, those who have wronged you or whom you hold responsible for bad things which have befallen you, and such. This effect usually lasts between one and ten minutes, and can be very distracting - or it can even focus you, if the thing you think about is related to the goal you are pursuing.

71-80: Talking Objects
Inanimate objects, either in your possession or vicinity, begin to talk to you. This seems absolutely reasonable at the time if you have more than 10 Insanity Points, and you are likely to reply, even being capable of holding long conversations with those objects. They can be surprisingly insightful, especially if they've been yours for a long time. Fortunately, only you can hear what they have to say to you, but others can hear your response.

80-100: Bleeding Corridors
By far the most distressingly common single manifestation of the Warp Whispers aboard the Occurrence Border, the hallways tend to bleed; sometimes it simply rains from the ceiling, sometimes weeps from the eyes of images and statuary, sometimes it just seeps out of the walls. This can be most distressing the first time you experience it, especially if you slip or get caught in a blood-shower, but everyone with any experience aboard the Occurrence Border will tell you that Warp blood washes out just fine.

## Lets Build Encounters
1.	Your spaceship comes across an enormous research vessel that seems to have been abandoned. Little does the party know, the crew of this 'abandoned' ship have been consumed by creatures with a natural cloaking ability, making them almost invisible.
2.	A mining space station in a planetary asteroid belt (rings?) is having difficulty with small asteroids seemingly 'attacking' the station. It is later found out that the asteroid belt as a whole is a sapient creature desperately trying to 'defend' itself.
3.	You see an asteroid moving towards you, upon closer inspection, It seems to be made out of living flesh.
4.	You detect a damaged vessel docked with the jump beacon. It appears the ship is absorbing metal from the beacon, risking destroying it and becoming stranded.
5.	You find the source of the distress call, a small research station. It appears a small laboratory fire got out of control and is threatening to destroy the station. Their fire suppression system is not responding.
6.	A large convoy of civilian ships appears to be passing through this region. You show no hostile intentions, but they are taking no chances, immediately sending their escort to attack.
7.	An enemy capital ship is using its gravity generators to make a blockade of asteroids, stopping external attack. This must mean their internal gravity is switched off however, making an internal attack... Complicated.
8.	An enemy ship has rerouted its gravity generators to throw asteroids at you from a nearby asteroid field
9.	A science station imploded a star during a test of a new weapon, but misjudged the size of the resulting black hole. They are now falling towards the event horizon, signalling mayday and a full evacuation.
10.	You are immediately hailed by a dangerous looking ship. "I'm feeling generous today. I shall allow you to choose your own death. Which do you like least: shields, oxygen, or weapons?" (whichever the party chooses, the enemy ships disable for the duration of the battle)
11.	You spy two pirate ships lurking in the nebula here. They remain unaware of your presence; You're able to get your scanners to at least identify their cargo: One is carrying the fuel supplies, the other the ammunition. They begin to drift away from each other in the storm.
12.	You jump into the middle of a plasma storm. Multiple recently incapacitated ships loom in the shadows, briefly illuminated by the lightning.
13.	You see a small station nearby and feel the shudder of shots ringing through the ship. You can't be sure without sensors, but it seems there may be intruders on the ship.
14.	Drifting in space you find a spherical metal structure the size of a small moon, Scanning it will reveal no signs of advanced technology or life forms but it will reveal a small hanger on the structure. If you land in the hanger you find it very plain and without any life support or artificial gravity systems but a small door on one wall big enough for a human to fit through but not much bigger. If you go through the door you will find a cube shaped room 10 meters long in all dimensions. On one wall is an inscription explaining that this structure is a giant mechanical computer but it does not say who built it and when. On the opposite wall to the inscription is a typewriter, a box of paper, a slit to put paper in, and a slit that paper can come out of. If the PCs type out messages on the typewriter and put them into the input slit than the computer’s response will come out of the output slit. The computer introduces itself as Socrates and explains that it simply wants to ponder the meaning of the universe in peace. Socrates appears to be of intelligence on par with a human but his responses take time to process(about 10 seconds for each word inserted into the input slit). If he sees the PCs as threatening to him the walls of the room and the hanger begin to close in.
15.	You find a illegal fueling station with a massive array of solar panels. The station offers the ship a full refuel if they are allowed to use the processing power of the ship’s computer for one hour, and offer to buy any computing equipment your ship may be carrying. Scans reveal that they have a much larger computer system that a station of that size requires. If the crew accepts the offer the ship will be refueled as promised with no negative effects on the ship or the ship’s computer. If they are forced to reveal what they are doing, the will admit that they are a religion that believes that through immense processing power they can calculate the equation that the entire universe is devised from.
16.	A crew member notices a group of manta ray like aliens drifting behind the ship appearing to feed off the ship’s exhaust. Scans show they are not a known species.
17.	You find the wreckage of two friendly ships that warped into the same space, something technically possible but statistically approaches impossibility.
18.	The o2 generator is broken through a spilled drink from one of the party members and they know they have x hours to fix it or find a habitable planet.
19.	A strange smell starts to emit from one of the containers in the cargohold. Upon inspection, your crew finds that the refridgeration of the alien meat fell out and it started to rot. When not immediately inspected, some sort of worms start to eat up all the food and, still ignored, these worms start to evolve and eat the ship like termites.
20.	A portion of space suddenly rips open and unfurls into a mass of tentacles surrounding a great maw. It pulls the ship towards its mouth. The maw is actually a wormhole to a destination of the GMs choice.
21.	You find an illegal garbage dump zone at a Lagrangian point. Most of it is trash, but there is some minor treasure to scavenge.
22.	On a newly colonized tropical pleasure planet, a crew member with an abnormally high Psi Score starts to hear voices. It turns out that the 3000km long coral reef is actually a sentient hive mind and it's pissed. If the crew doesn't stop the locals from dynamiting the reef to build hotels, it's going to start causing brain embolisms in people until there are no humans left. A computer model shows it could wipe out the population of ten million people in five days.
23.	You didn't think much about that shipping container full of alien artifacts that museum asked you to haul. That is, until last night when something inside tore through the container's steel wall and escaped into the air ducts. Inside the container you find seventy-three one meter long sealed sarcophagi... and one broken open.
24.	Those twenty shipping containers labeled "Childrens' Pajamas" you're delivering? One of them broke open while moving stuff around the hold and it appears to be filled with very illegal automatic weapons. Oh yeah, and the Space Patrol just hailed your ship for a surprise inspection.
25.	On an isolated colony, bare knuckle boxing has become popular. So has a locally grown and refined performance enhancing drug that turns its users into sociopathic murderers. Worse, about a quarter of them learn to hide their impulses and instead become highly effective serial killers... and they're beginning to emigrate back into the galaxy's general population.
26.	Argus Nine is a fully automated mining facility on the surface of a metal rich asteroid. The crew visits for its biannual pickup of refined ore only to find all the mining equipment disassembled and the supposedly non-sentient robots separated into warring religious factions, one that worships humans as their creators and the other sworn to exterminate them.
27.	On a colony, you encounter a scientist with an aptitude for cloning limbs. He asks if anyone would be a willing test subject for his latest project.
28.	The group comes accross a space station, that's sending a distress signal. There are hundreds of people in there, being slaughtered by giant spiders.
29.	The ship is hailed by a group of freighters far away. Scans reveal they are being harassed by smaller combat ships. The captain of the main freighter asks for their help in dealing with the pirates, but at some point in the fight, it's revealed that the pirates stole the cargo ships, and the real merchants are the ones in the combat ships.
30.	A random guy teleports into the bridge, and offers to be a janitor. If you refuse, he will fight with a small phaser, but should you let him join your crew, he will do his job just fine.
31.	The ship receives a message from a nearby moon, asking the crew to come down to discuss a quest. Turns out the moon is a space whale sanctuary, where these creatures breed and grow. There is a small community of warriors, sworn to protect the sanctuary. They know hunters are coming, and need the player's help.
32.	The players come across a massive trade station. There, they are approachedd by a scientist, who says a great evil from another dimension has awoken within the system, and will soon destroy it. Should the players investigate, they will find a giant portal in a jungle planet, surrounded by bizarre monsters.
33.	A monolithic ship, nearly as black as the space around it, suddenly appears out of warp and hails the party in a strange language. The design is unlike anything the party has ever seen. They don't seem hostile...
34.	A group of strange, whale-like creatures peacefully pass the ship. The scanner will show up blank no matter how many times the party tries.
35.	There’s a Wormhole to... somewhere. Your scanners can’t quite figure out where.
36.	An automated salvage vessel mistakenly flags the party’s ship as scrap, and attempts to collect its parts.
37.	A strange combat drone engages the ship. It can only move by firing a plasma launcher in the opposite direction.
38.	A supply merchant ship hails the party and offers to trade with them. Declining angers the merchants, and they will continue to ask to trade until either a transaction is made or a fight breaks out. Their prices are fair, though.
39.	Two automated battleships are in a perpetual battle with each other around a red dwarf star. Neither has functional thrusters, transmitters, or anything besides solar panels, mirror plating, and an assortment of laser weapons. Unfortunately, neither can be damaged by the others lasers, due to the mirrors.
40.	A small ocean planet comes into view, with a distress beacon coming from its surface. If the ship approaches the planet, they will be warned by a castaway on the planet of an ancient defense system that will try to shoot down anything that enters the atmosphere.
41.	You find the remains of two nomad plants that fell into each other’s gravitational pull and collided. A breathing view, but ultimately not useful for much other that pictures.
42.	A very small moon is home to a small shop of tiny friendly aliens. They sell moon rocks and preserved tiny bugs from their little home as souvenirs.
43.	An unknown species' equivalent of a voyager probe. How long has it been travelling? Where from and what is the species doing now? Does it even still exist in a recognizable form?
44.	A gigantic intelligent leviathan creature is drifting between stars at sub-light speed. It contacts the ship telepathically to explain that it rescued some humans/pc race some time ago and has been sustaining them in one of many large cysts on its flanks. It asks you to take them off its "hands" as their presence is physically irritating, like a tick, because they are literally living off its body and fluids. The creature had not realized the difference in lifespans and so had no idea that his passengers are 6th generation inhabitants who have never known any other life except as oral legend and are terrified at the idea of leaving.
45.	Lemon juice rations you brought to combat scurvy have gone missing. An investigation reveals that it was stolen by the janitorial staff in an attempt to brew alcohol.
46.	You find a abandoned small space station near a tiny moon. Scans show something extremely strange: the station is not orbiting the moon, but rather the moon is orbiting the station, which has a mass 10 times greater than that of the moon.
47.	A wrecked cargo ship. Huge weapon damage but it looks like a lot of the cargo remains inside. The only problem is the cracked core which continues to flood the ship and near space with radiation.
48.	A small mining colony on the small moon of an inhabited planet. The planet is middle ages tech level on its two main continents with a couple of areas starting renaissance-style thinking. The colony has mined the far side till it risks breaking up and are fighting over whether to start on the near-side and affecting the locals.
49.	Your ship emerges quite far away from the jump beacons coordinates. You see a pirate ship waiting nearby the jump beacon exit; undoubtedly stationed to look for unarmed vessels that fall into its trap.
50.	You follow the distress beacon to a small asteroid belt. You find a small ship struggling to maneuver through the field. They message you, "Help! Our shields are down and I don't know how much longer we can last!"
51.	You are hailed by a small colony on a a planet. A few weeks ago, the moon orbiting the planet disappeared, and nobody knows what happened to it.
52.	A massive diamond shaped space craft comes out of warp. It seems to be sub consciously beckoning the party to come aboard
53.	The party receives a mysterious distress call that comes from a empty system. When they inspect it further, they find an abandoned ship that looks exactly like theirs. When they check it further, they find bodies of people that look exactly like them. They had been sending a distress signal to themselves
54.	The ship's recycler is on the fritz and your food has started to look more and more like feces
55.	A smattering of high-velocity(missiles, lasers, tungsten slugs, whatever) tear past the ship- analysis suggests they are the remains of a centuries-old battle.
56.	A gigantic mechanical skull drifts through the void of space past the ship. One of its gigantic eyes follows the ship, but does nothing.
57.	A heavy battleship, long-decommissioned and turned into a spaceport, has had it's combat AI reactivated and is now firing on all docking ships.
58.	An abandoned science shuttle drifts in orbit around a seemingly-empty planet. Analysis suggests the whole crew was killed by the common cold.

60.	An automated battleship attacks the party
61.	The party's ship is caught in a gravitational anomaly and forced to crash on an unknown planet
62.	You come across a damaged ship that is drifting in space. Scans reveal that it is on emergency power and life support is in danger of shutting down. They also reveal that there are 6 people in cryoberths. If the group wakes them they will have no memory of who they are.
63.	Come out of hyperspace/jump/warp in the middle of a very chaotic battle in a system that is not the one you were attempting to travel to.
64.	The party is offered a job to escort a delivery to a penal colony on a small moon in the system. When they arrive things seem a little off. If they pry (or are very observant) they figure out that the inmates have taken over and are running the place. Do they join them, try to stop them, or just ignore the fact?
65.	Something went terribly wrong with the last jump. You were in jump space 2x as long as normal and now you come out and are in complete darkness. No stars. No planets. Just void. Turns out they jumped into the middle of an extremely large Dyson sphere (aka hollow planet).
66.	Someone ate all the rations, and you are still a week out from the next destination.... was it a crew member or is there a stowaway?
67.	The ships computer gives a puzzling report. Something in your cargo hold has been growing heavier after every FTL jump.

69.	You see a large spaceport filled with many tourist ships. Apparently, a local star is about to go supernova in a week, and many visitors from across the system have come to witness the event.
70.	The party finds a damaged and disable ship floating in space. Upon entering they find it is covered in ice and many of the crew are encapsulated in it. They find one person alive with no ice immediately around them. They are muttering about how it is still too hot.
71.	The party discover that a moderately important drift beacon has an inevitable guarding it, destroying anything that gets nearby
72.	The party finds a library bigger than one that they can remember. It's librarian is a dragon, who demands a large price to using it's books.
73.	Party discovers a compound filled with undead, and turrets that shoot anyone who tries to harm an undead.
74.	In a city the party sees a person openly stealing things, and no one seems to notice or care.
75.	The crew come across a kilometer wide, dense mass of musical birthday cards floating out in space. As they investigate, a cloud of assembly oozes bleeds out and attacks their ship, nibbling at it and turning it into more birthday cards.
76. You find an asteroid floating in space. It seems safe to enter, but when you break open the door there is an explosion which terribly injures the being within. Taking him home, you find he is an indestructible psychopath who was sealed into that asteroid by his race for his terrible, sadistic crimes
77. A small planetary colony without ships of their own is about to be wiped out by some form of disaster, and only the party can arrive in time. Unfortunately, the party's ship only has enough room for half of the colonists to survive.
78. As the party enters a unexplored star system, they recieve a message in an unknown language sent from what seems to be a point inside the star's outer layer.
79. The ships computer gives a puzzling report. Something in your cargo hold has been growing heavier after every FTL jump.
