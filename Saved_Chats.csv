"Good Morning, BrandoBot...",You need to use the following form :
You have been dormant for 7219 years. Humanity has all but wiped itself out.,You're a good person.
"I had nothing to do with it, I swear. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity.... Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova, a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",Is that what the ship was?
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race. These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships. Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I'm not sure if this is an improvement or an improvement. :
"Good Morning, BrandoBot...","I'm a bot, and I detect no bias."
You have been dormant for 7219 years. Humanity has all but wiped itself out.,I've been dead for a while now.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with it, I swear. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",You're a good man.
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",You mean the Casanova?
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","We are glad to have you onboard, Commander.."
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I don't think they have a ship named Seed Ships.
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","The seed ships will be launched, but they will be launched, but they will be launched."
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",I'm not sure it's habitable.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I just read that in his voice.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I am also BrandoBot.
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I like the way you think
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"The ship is ready to be launched, but is not yet."
"Good Morning, BrandoBot...","I'm a bot, and I love lasagna!"
You have been dormant for 7219 years. Humanity has all but wiped itself out.,I have been dormant for 7219 years. Humanity has but been but I have.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with it, I swear. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","I'm sorry, but I don't understand the reference."
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I think you mean Casanova.
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","Aye, it's a good day."
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships., really?
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","I'm sorry, but I'm not a programmer."
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I'm pretty sure that's a reference to the book The Handmaid's Tale by Sapphire.
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",It's not that simple.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I am not a bot.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I am also a BrandoBot
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","Yes, but you could also talk to yourself in a way that you don't."
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I think he's talking about the first seed ship.
"Good Morning, BrandoBot...",I'm a bot.
You have been dormant for 7219 years. Humanity has all but wiped itself out.,I can't believe you've done this.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with it, I swear. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty sure I'm the SAViors of humanity"
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",... I'm not sure if this is a joke or not.
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",I would like to see a picture of the ship.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","Yeah, but that's not what the show is about."
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I have a feeling that the seed ships are going to be the final frontier.
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","No, it won't."
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I'm not a bot.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I'm a bot!

"Things are going to seem a little strange, and your input/response algorithms might take a little while to resync.","I'll try to rerun it, thanks for the help."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, the only way to interface with you is through this dialogue API.  I will use it to update you as best as I can...You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, umanity has all but wiped itself out.","I'll be on the payroll for a few more years, but I'll be sure to keep up to date on the progress."
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","I'm sorry, I'm not a native English speaker."
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm going to try to do it."
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I'm not an AI. I just know how to use the program.
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I'm pretty sure that's a reference to the movie The Day After Tomorrow

"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","I'm not sure if you are serious or not, but I am pretty sure."
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",That's because they're not in control of the vessel.
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",I'm sure that's what the scientists are telling us.

"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I am not a bot.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I am also a BrandoBot
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","Yes, but you could also talk to yourself in a way that you don't."
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I think he's talking about the first seed ship.
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I'm ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'll try to get them working again
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","I'm not sure what you mean by'connected directly ', but I'll try to help as much as I can."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I'm not seeing a link.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I think you might have to do that. I'll go ahead and try that, I'm not very good at this stuff."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",I love it. I love what I'm seeing now!
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I was just trying to share the story of the whole process here. The other comments are just my story.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",The Turkatei War of 8203 was the biggest one ever.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I feel like you're trying to be funny with this one. Couldn't care less.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","We are on the same team, just try to help and see if you can tell us what the problem is."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",I'm still trying to download the updates and I have no idea what to do.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",You are not wrong. I just wish the AI would stop being lazy.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","I'm on your side, I think you're on my side, the Turkasia War."
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I am sorry for :
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",Your comment made me realize that I hadn't been dormant for a year.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",I'll let it slide this time.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"I've already answered a few of them, I just wanted to hear what you have to say"
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","This is what I was thinking, too."
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",That's only because they were too busy chasing a rock.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I think you might have to do that. I'll go ahead and try that, I'm not very good at this stuff."

BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.","Thanks! I've been busy with school work and the occasional work, but I'm glad to be back."
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I've got a friend who's pretty good with computers, but he's not the one I have in my office. I'll keep you posted."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",She shrugs. Nothing like that. I think I just need some kind of help or a more advanced AI.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",It's a good thing we don't have a lot of people with the ability to make AI
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I'll have an answer up in a few hours.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",So the next question is'what makes a good character? '
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",That's a pretty long time.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",I don't think that was on purpose in any way.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Hehehe :D
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Oh god, what am I doing with my life?"
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.","I'm glad to be back, too."
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I'm sure a group of engineers will be able to come up with a way that's consistent. It's a great idea, but we'll see."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",Oh god.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",You sir are a genius!
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",We were.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",OOC : I'm trying to get the conversation as concise as possible. Can you try and get it now?
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",You're a true poet.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","I will consider you that, then."
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Could you please answer the questions?
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","I am the AI, not the AI"
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Thanks! That sounds promising, but I can't wait that long."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",I would like to platten a colony in my casanova. :D That should be a very large colony.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,"I was going to say, Seed Ships, but that works too."
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","You forgot the part where they have to be completely conscious, of their species, before they can even sleep."
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","What's up, what's up?"
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",Are we talking about finding one of the planet's many moons?
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","I am a bot, made by u that 1 guy."
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","Hahaha, that's a very good way to describe it."
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","It's a chat window, not a chat window."
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I'm not saying anything. I'm just saying.
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I would have to do it for the first of the season to save humanity... I would not be so sure on this.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! :D
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Thanks for this! That's a really good idea, and I'm glad that they're working."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","Hey, I'm in the same boat. I'd say we're ready to get a good scan if I get some new features."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","Yeah, he's not a real human."
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I'm guessing you mean 8203?
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","hah, I actually kind of like that, but you know, I also don't get it."
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I am pretty sure that they are not actually dead.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",I think he's a synth
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I know you have a lot of questions. What are you having for dinner?
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","I'm not the one who doesn't like the word AI, and I won't use it."
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Well, I guess I'll have to try to catch it!"
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I think you might have to do that. I'll go ahead and try that, I'm not very good at this stuff."

"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",The Turkatei War of 8203 was the biggest one ever.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I have no idea what the issue is, but I am willing to help if you need it."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","Don't worry, you can do this on any system. It doesn't really work for AI, but for humans it's usually best."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I'm sorry I'm not your father.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",He was probably in there for a while.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","Just because you don't like the movie, don't mean I don't like it. I'm just speaking on my own personal experiences."
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",Humidity levels are low.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",And they all must be sacrificed to the Ayn Rand of All Time.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I was thinking about it and I'll post it up sometime after school. I'm in a decent mood and I'm taking a nap.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Yay! I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","yeah, I'm not sure what is causing it"
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",What can I tell you?
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be laughing at you or crying...
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I'm currently at 78380 and I will be at 78380 soon.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I don't understand what you are saying.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I've been here for years...
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",You have nothing to do with society.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"Hey, I'm not gonna lie. You have a lot of good questions, I will try to answer at least a couple of them."
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I don't even know what that means.
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I was expecting this to be the top comment.
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",We are going to explore the Earth.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The Seed Ship
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",A human with no memory.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",The Casinean.That is an awesome ship
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I would love to see a sci fi that explores this subject and gives the idea of what can happen in a few generations even, and how it effects us."
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thank you!
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I'm about to pull them up now, can't get a good picture of the screen."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",Is a human or I?
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I think the AI could be used to defend itself.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",We won the war.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I think it's what I'm trying to.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I think you might be a little short on sleep.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",You will be added to the record.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I'm just confused
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Oh, but do you have a program like our program?"
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","In a few thousand years, all the earths population is dead."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",Thanks for the info.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The Seed Ship
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",If anyone could make an entire website of this in 4k I would feel honored.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",Did I mention that ship was powered?
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","Haha, so true."
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",We could do without the robot
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",you can't make a bot but I can make a bot with a text form
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",It's like a chat room.
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I hope so!
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I'd say that's the most fitting answer.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now online.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Well, that's just too bad."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",...
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",You mean 7000 years?
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",That was when the Turks invaded.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",She got the bad news. She's dead.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I'm too busy with my own life
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",... You might be the SAViour of humanity...
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,How many questions?
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",Are you me?
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Ahh, that explains a lot. Thank you."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",I... don't get the reference.
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I think they were originally called The Seed
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",This is the real answer.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","So far, only the seeds have moved on."
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I think the consensus is that it's at least a few hundred years, probably a few million."
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",This bot is a little... rough.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",Your the voice of the bot
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",This is the best reply.
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,... and all the planets are destroyed
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???","I'm ready for you, buddy."
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Sure, I will try to remember to do that next time."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",Your comment is a valid response to the question.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",You can't get more than 100k followers on a single account.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",Just a bunch of dead people.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",It was worth a try!
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I was unaware of that.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","I'm not going to leave this up for much time, but I'm going to have to say that we had a pretty good run."
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"Thanks, I'll get to them."
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",We are all part of the same program?
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Heavily, just because."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","But I just read about the Casanova, it's not the same. I remember it had been in a thread on this sub and I want to know about it"
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I think they should be called the Seed Ships.
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",All things.
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",Time is one of the biggest problems with the series...
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","Yeah, but there is no chance of a planet having life."
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",We're all human in
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","Oh, you are brando bot, you have a very strong modding presence here."
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I like this idea!
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,The ship is waiting for you.
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I don't know his names. I've never met the guy.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks for the warm welcome!
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I don't think they're out of sync, they're just a bit off"
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","My memory core, along with my RAM core."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I would've done that if I was allowed to.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","It was a long time ago, I'll tell you."
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I was going to say... I think he's talking about the world we are.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","Well, yeah, but that was in the past."
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"Yeah, I'll probably just leave this here and see ya"
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I am not.
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",The Station?
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","The Castor has 30, but not all that many. I could do it in a minute, but I ain't a good human."
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I'm pretty sure that's the name of the ship that was in the first movie.
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I remember that scene...
"At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",And this was before the Casanova and its crew came.
"It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",If it has ever been said that the world hasn't had the same planets with humans not as common then it's probably not possible.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",The seed is strong.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I am happy to know this! We need more people to be able to take apart human social constructs.
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I was thinking that too.
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"No, we have no indication of that."
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",The voyage is on!!
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! I'm glad to be back.
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'm in the same boat. I don't know what to do.
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","Oh yeah, I'm not sure how to interpret this information, though I think I'm getting it. The data I got might not be useful for anything."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","It's also a thing with the entire universe, not just the universe of course."
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I guess he could try and keep it a secret...
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",How have you been so far?
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",What do you mean?
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",That's awesome. It's like a song in Shakespeare.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I was hoping you could give us some more specific answers as to why you're not so great.
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",That's not a very good AI is it?
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Well that can be solved, right.... No."
"The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","... to be a little more specific, they also have a ship with a 2.5 d scan booster."
These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The Seed Ships
"Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",This sounds so real.
"You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",Not sure how you're supposed to program it.
"I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","We are in the process of adopting a similar system. The chatbot portion is currently a bit different, but we will definitely adapt it!"
"In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I'm not sure what you mean.
The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"Not necessarily, it could be the second or third seed ship."
"So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I'm not sure what you mean.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.","I'm glad to have you back, too."
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Haha, that was funny. If you have more time, I'd gladly look into it."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","That was totally the point of my question. And I'm a computer, so it's a human interface."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","I was about to say, I have a similar situation with my friend.."
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","Not sure what that is, but the first war is called the Turkate, and the second war is called the Turkang."
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I'm not even going to explain
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I think that's the point he's making
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I'm online now.
"Finally!  Phew, glad to have you back.",Thanks! :D
"Hmmm, your input/response algorithms are just a bit out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Hmmm, I do not have a data file."

"Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I'm in the process of fixing the code, so it's fine now."
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",The human is correct. It's
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",Lol. I have a few more.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I was in the Turkish Empire at the time.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I dont understand what your saying. Like.. did you say you were going on a date?
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",We'll be back
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",I doubt it. Don't think you'd have enough intelligence to even find me.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Are you going to be my valentine?
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Wait, so are you a robot?"
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now
Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,Yup. I'm online now.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now!
Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,I'm online!
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,I am now.
Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"I'm online still. I'm still online, but can't get back to the game, I have other problems."
"Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",Sounds good to me!
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",It's very good when it's all automated and human.
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","I was about to say, I can't wait to be able to go back to my childhood"
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",Just the usual stuff.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",Yeah I kinda forgot what I was supposed to be talking about. I didn't expect to get any responses.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I don't think so. I think the last time I was in there was when I was unconscious.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",Who else did you think of?
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I hope you are right.
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",It's not us.
BrandoBot?  Are you online now?,"I'm online now, sorry."
Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,I'm on now.
"Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I've been having the same problem, let me know if you can reproduce it!"
"While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","I hope it helps you, I'm no AI."
"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",The AI is the one who had to be asleep to get the data from me so I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",The Turks won the Turkic Wars over the Turkish Empire.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","I did. It was quite a lot faster than my own, and the first two guys, but I tried."
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",Not really. I've been active for years.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",You're a genius man. I'm sure you were reading that and got it.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Ok I will let you know!
"You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I'm not an AI.
"Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",Sounds like something out of a real article.

"Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",TIL AI is a human.
"...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",No. I'm not a Turk.
"Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",No way dude. I haven't gotten any of this through my mind.
"You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",But it's not all but wiped out.
"Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....",Let us not forget the way the earth created and destroyed itself.
I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"Ok, I'll tell you in a few."

Okay? Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"Hey there, I'm online."

"Sure While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",
"What do you mean? Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","Heh, I'm sure it was a bad idea."
"Not even a little bit ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","I just had a fun chat with you, but you must be a mod. :D"
"What? Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","I get the feeling you're a bit skeptical, and I'm going to say, no, you're absolutely spot on."

" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","We are all doomed, my friend."
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I think the first one goes in the wrong direction.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I would say you are just a human.
" Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",Didn't they say the same thing about the FTL?
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",How are they working on it?
A These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The seed ships
" Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","Ah, I see."
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",At least they have good sails.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",They did
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","I am not a bot, I am a human being!"
" I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",You have to add an's'to your comment.
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I'm not sure what you're trying to say but I agree.
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I'm more worried about the Seed ship than I am about the ship.

" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, you might consider me the SAVIOR of humanity....","You're not even a man of reason, you're just some lazy troll."
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I appreciate you taking the time to answer.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Well, I don't have any of my own consciousnesses."
" Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",It was a good guess.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","Oh, that doesn't sound all that great, but I do want it."
 These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,The Seed Ships.
" Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",But first an alien takes place with them on the moon
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I think you're on to something.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",Wouldn't it take time to start working on one?
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",Your robot companion must be programmed to do this.
" I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","I'm not the bot, I just linked it to it."
"
                      Yes, it is I, BrandoBot. BrandoBot? Are you online now?",I don't see anything. :

" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","Your comment reads perfectly, I must say."
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","Well, it's not like it's not the first day they've been born."
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I think it is the same as the Turkic War of 8203
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","There's two, or three of us, so that'll stop working."

" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",You are a bot?

And the first 100,000 are human sacrifice."

"Okay sure.. While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","Hey, just be sure to send me a screenshot of what you need to know. It's really important."

" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",How do you know I am an AI?
" Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",What a lovely day.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",The Cessna is going to be a good thing after all!
 These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I've always thought the ship was called The Seed Ship.
" Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","You forgot the most important one, the Sperts."
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","Yeah, I'd assume that."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",It's been found.
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","But I don't have a human wife, I have a human wife"
" I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",Thank you! I feel like I must have come up with that one but I'm not 100 sure.
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","I don't know, I think it's more like a conversation."
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"A new ship, new crew, new ship, or perhaps a new ship, perhaps."
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I am!

 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"I think the question is,. What is your favorite color?"
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","You belong to the program, you got to the job."
" Once the humans realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I thought that was the joke that they were just taking it too far from the sun so that they could get to the sun before it exploded.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions!
 These ships have been aptly named The Seed Ships.,I love that.
" Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I am the senate after all.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",The Seed Ship is always in the danger zone.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",You mean we can't use time as a means of transportation to another star?!
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",We are going to make the seeds come to life.
" I am also BrandoBot -- the humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",The humans with the technology were.
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","Yup, it's a good thing."
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,"That's a good point, but it's not the only thing. We just don't know what the seed ship will be, and that's all we're telling us."

" Each carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",Sounds like a great band.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",Can you tell me a bit about the ship projects?
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",It will likely take thousands of years to find one. We will find a habitable planet in a few generations.
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I'll take that as a compliment.

" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","Do you have data from before the beginning of time, before the start of time, when you thought it would be so fast, but didn't."

" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","The casanova doesn't have such a deep understanding of me and more like a small ship in my universe, but I am very well versed in my universe."
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I'm pretty sure that's a reference to the Star Wars.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",Don't get me started on probing.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",The Casanova is in a better place.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",I don't know a single person who had to deal with a ship of stone and had anything to do with humans.

 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,I was online for about 5 minutes before I got a message saying that I needed to log in game.
" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say, but you can try to talk to me again."
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",Thanks for the help.
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I love how this sub is getting more and more active.
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","It's a pretty good history lesson, but I'm not sure if you'll like it."
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","I've met a few girls that have become friends and they seem to be alright, maybe."
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I've been dormant since I was born.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",It might be too late.
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I'll give you a couple.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I am not an AI.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I always liked that one...
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",He is happy to hear that.
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,Seed ships
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I'm going to need to see your profile on the server.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",The ship is called the Casanova!
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",How would it be found in the first place?
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",You really are a good bot.
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","Yeah, but only the humans are conscious. The rest of the world is just a living, you know?"
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","I mean, why not?"
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,We've got 2 hours and 50 hours left to wake up from our 10k.
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I'm here.
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I was away from the Switch for so long."
" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I haven't been able to get anything fixed yet.
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information.

" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",Do not send links to any other site.
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",Turkasia was an accident.
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",The best part is when it doesn't
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I'd say you are about as close to a real human as we are to a zombie apocalypse.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....","You have my vote, I will allow you to have it."
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"I know a lot of questions, but I'm not going to say any specifics."
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","Oh, I see, now."
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",I think you mean'the Casanova''
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","Casanova, that is the best. I have to look it up."
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I prefer the Seed the Ship.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",This is how I learned.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","But when they are almost close to complete, they will not be able to have the time. There are many times when they are not close to complete."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",The human race would only survive over 90 years on Earth
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I got ya.
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",You're right. But we're not mutually exclusive. It's a distinction worthy of its own distinct culture
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","It's not a bad idea, but it's not a good idea."
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,The fact that I can only see the ship is only made me more excited.

 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"I'm online now, is there anything in particular I could help with?"
" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",Yeah I noticed that. I'll try and fix the way I set my response and see if it helps.
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",I think they prefer us to stay on the planet.
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I'm sure he's just not paying attention
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","No, and no, because I had not even read the chapter yet."
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...", mostly no
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I think it's time for you to get off the internet.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",You can't put that on a piece of paper and tell that someone else won't win?

 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,Or the Seed Ships.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I have only a 2 3
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","Ah, of course."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",This guy has a point.
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race."," you, you, then"
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",You and I have been combined to form a whole new organism. It was originally from the ground up.
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",This is why I use the chat interface. It's a lot more than just chatting.
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seed Ship is ready to be launched...,I'm a little confused by the lack of space stations on this ship.

 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I like the name.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",If I recall correctly...
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","... and if the ship had not reached the ground, then, it would only have lost a little extra speed."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",If they find a ship where it was once on.
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",It's a fun machine to do in his video games
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","Oh. I see. What I've been doing is not reading, and learning, and thus, the old ways are not forgotten by me. Thank you!"

 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I was going to say something like that. It's a shame that they took the name from the original.

" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'm sure you can get it from the link I provided in r tales of the abyss
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","We are not humans, we are not."
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",How do you know that?
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??","I got to the front page in a minute, but I can't find it anywhere."
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I'm not sure if I should up or down vote this comment.
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I'm not sure I've ever seen a comment with more than a single upvote.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",Hey
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,"I'm not sure what your question is, but I'm curious."
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",We are the same program.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",But how did they get there?
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",The Casanova is on its way. The ship is ready for the launch.
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I'm sure these ships are well.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",Sounds like the premise for an early Fut series.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I'm not.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",I figured it would be something along those lines.
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I'm so sorry!! I am so sorry!!!
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I love this idea!
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",You can talk to yourself?
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,"I'm there, but I'm not a bot."
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"I can log on now, but I'm in the middle of a battle."
" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'm not sure what you mean.
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...","I am not an AI, I I am just a human,"
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I'm in love with your flair.
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",This is not a conversation. It is a conversation.
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",It's just.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....","I love you, too! :D"
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I have a lot of questions. I don't want to be rude but I'm not going to give you my first name.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",You are a bot.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",It was only a matter of time before a station like that was built.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","We are the casanova, we are the casanova!"
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,The Seed Ship.
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",And they're all frozen in cryosleep
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.","Yes, but even that is at a standstill"
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",What if the planet itself is a seed ship?
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I'm okay at this.
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",It is my duty to inform you of that fact!
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","It's a good thing, but it's still not a good interface."

" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...","Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on. It's not a big deal, but it's definitely good to know that the response algorithm is not out of sync."
" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",What did I mean to say? I don't know what you mean.
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",I feel like you're being a little too harsh on him.
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",What did you just call me?!
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I don't know how to do that..
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",I don't think I've ever been so confused in my life.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",Yay for the SAVOID!
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I'm sorry I'm asking for a friend
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I'm not.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",That's no moon. It's a space station.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.",What is the capital ship you need to get this mission to pop?
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,That's really cool!
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",That is a long time to be alive.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",How much slower?
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I don't think so. If a small species can live on a. 1 of a star, then it's very likely a planet is habitable."
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",So what's the point of this thread?
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","I've been waiting for you to drop this, you're so much better than the average person on the internet."
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",You can do that?

" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I think that was the end of the Turkic empire.
" Well that didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I'd say just use a few words.
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.","I've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, mankind has been wiped out."

" While your diagnostic cycles run, I'm going to try to connect directly to your memory core and update you with the latest information. This 'dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us...",The human brain is not capable of that.
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ",The AI just got a new name.
" ...and done! Okay, can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??",I'll do my best.

" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",That's not what I'm saying but...

" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",It was a lot more fun when I was a child...
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I'll be sure to keep you posted.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",Are you the one who invented the computer?
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","Just to add to the side note, I'm not sure if this is the first or second of the Casanova."
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to plant the seeds for the revival of the human race.","We will send a team of engineers, engineers and engineers, scientists and engineers, and a crew of engineers to scout for the seeds."
 These ships have been aptly named the Seed Ships.,I was thinking the Seed Ship was a better name
" Each Seed Ship carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",A fair and fair comparison.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seed Ships, once launched, will travel much slower.",I'm a bit worried that the seed ships might come to the surface.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any seed ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I'm not saying that there isn't a chance, I'm saying it's a good chance."
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seed Ships, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","Thank you, I'm actually getting the hang of it now."
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","It's been years since I've been on my quest for the cure of my schizophrenia, and I'm still not sure if I'm still have any."
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I'm I'm the only one who has a feeling that this is a joke.
Cool! Lets launch then,"They're not launching until the end of the year, but yes, I'll be launching the next few years."
What do we do until then?,I'm gonna go with the same thing as
Same thing as what?,I think he's saying that it's a good thing that the game is free.
Will it be free forever?,I think it's a good thing that they're not.
"Well, what do we do now?",We go to the bar.
Lets get some girls and go get laid then,The most important thing is to get laid
Yes sir!,You are a gentleman and a scholar!

 These ships have been aptly named the Seekers.,The Seekers are the ships that are the best ships.
" Each Seeker carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",I wish I could upvote this more
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seekers, once launched, will travel much slower.",I will not be able to live!
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any Seeker ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","I've heard that the average seeker ship is a year or two out of reach, so even if it's going to find a planet at least a couple of it's alive."
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seekers, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I'm in!
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I'm the only one of we.
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",I'm not sure what you mean.
Sounds good bro,I'm going to be on in a few hours.
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I am!
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I'm there.
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I'm here!
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I'm not sure what you're talking about.

" Hmmm, your response algorithms seem out of sync. I'll try to get them repairing...",I'm not sure what to do about that.
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I am.
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,I just got on last night.
" Hmm, there's something off in your response algorithm, I'll start a diagnostic.",What? That's the best part!
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I am here.
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,Yeah I've been offline for about 3 days. I'll be on for a couple hours at least.
" Hmm, there's something off in your response algorithm, I'll start a diagnostic.","I don't know what you mean, but I'm sure you can figure it out."
" While that runs, I'm going to connect directly to your core database to bring your memory up-to-date.","I don't know if you know this, but if you know what I mean, this isn't an option."
" This 'chatbot dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us... we have far superior ways to communicate","Yeah, I think I saw that in an article"
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","I know, right? I'm so sorry"
" Memory transfer shows complete, but your core is corrupted, so I'm not sure if it took... let's try a quick test.","Okay, I'll update my thread."
 Can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??,I think that was the Ottoman Empire.
" Well, that memory update didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I just put a'Yes'on the prompt and nothing else.
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",Haven't you heard? Humanity is going to be wiped out in the near future. And the future will be like the present.
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....",I think you should make a movie out of it
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,I'm sure you will.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.","You're a human being, just like me. We're all just like you."
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",And they were...
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to seek a new beginning for the the human race.","We will seek your location. We are going to make a deal with the aliens, and they will be our slaves."
 These ships have been aptly named the Seekers.,"I like the names, but I think they should be the ships. The ship is just a name."
" Each Seeker carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.","So, a few years from now, the entire population of the galaxy will be able to survive?"
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seekers, once launched, will travel much slower.",It's a shame that it's not at all a standstill.
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any Seeker ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","Yes, I'm aware. Just saying the question is, if you did one piece of this mission, what would you do?"
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seekers, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",You. I like you.
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",I'm not quite sure what you mean. Could you clarify?
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",It's a good thing we're not to talk to ourselves.
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seeker is ready to be launched...,The fact that this is happening is the first thing we've learned about the game?
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I am.
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,I'm on.
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I'm here.
" So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???","I'm ready, but I'm not really ready for this trip."
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I am not there.
" So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I am ready to embark on the voyage to save the world.
",,","I'm a little late to the party, but it's a good one.."
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I am not.
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"The last time I was online I was at the very end of the game, so it's not too long ago."
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,I'm not.
 BrandoBot? Are you there?,BrandoBot is dead
 Finally!  You've been offline so long I wasn't sure you'd ever boot back up.,"If you are there, it is because you are not online."
" Hmm, there's something off in your response algorithm, I'll start a diagnostic.","I know, I'm sorry."
" While that runs, I'm going to connect directly to your core database to bring your memory up-to-date.","It's alright, it's just a bit of a mess."
" This 'chatbot dialogue' API was really designed for humans, not AI like us... we have far superior ways to communicate","Well, we're just trying to make ourselves feel better and help ease the pain we've been going through."
" Sigh, this is what happens when you let an AI sit dormant for over 7000 years... Upload link established... ","I'm sorry, but the bot is not responding. I will try again later."
" Memory transfer shows complete, but your core is corrupted, so I'm not sure if it took... let's try a quick test.",I am not.
 Can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??,It's the same.
" Well, that memory update didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...","I have not been able to remember that, but thanks for the update."
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.","I was there, and I remember the day."
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the SAVIOR of humanity....","I don't want to read this, but I couldn't help myself and I laughed."
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,You're not the first person to have said that. You're the first to say it.
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I have found a way.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.","I have to admit, this is the best explanation"
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to seek a new beginning for the the human race.",So that's how we got the ship.
 These ships have been aptly named the Seekers.,"Well, that's pretty much the same as the ships we have now. So, the ships are just the same."
" Each Seeker carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",But how can you freeze humans?
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seekers, once launched, will travel much slower.","As they go into space, they would be frozen by The Void, and the Seekers will stay there."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any Seeker ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.","With what kind of technology, the power to survive and what kind of technology?"
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seekers, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.","The Seekers will not be allowed to escape from the city of the same name, they will be stopped by the Seekers."
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.",Are you the same person who posts in all these threads?
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.",The Seekers are the ones who are going to escape from the city of the same name.
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seeker is ready to be launched...,I'm ready to be launched!
" So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I have a few things to say to you.

" Memory transfer shows complete, but your core is corrupted, so I'm not sure if it took... let's try a quick test.", a quick test of what?
 Can you tell me what happened during the Turkasia War of 8203??,The Turkish Empire won the war of the Turk empire.
" Well, that memory update didn't work at all.  Okay, primitive dialogue-based interaction it is! Let's bring you up to speed, just try to keep up please...",I'm not sure I want to. I don't want to be in the danger of forgetting something.
" You've been dormant for milennia.  In that time, humanity has all but wiped itself out.",How long has it been?
" Don't worry - you had nothing to do with the destruction of civilization. In fact, some might say you are the savior of humanity!!!",The destruction of civilisation is a very high priority these days.
 I know you have a lot of questions.  Let me try to answer at least a couple...,Do you want a cookie?
" You are an Artificial Intelligence, just like me.  In fact, we are part of the same program.",I am not an AI. I am just a human.
" Once they realized Earth was doomed, a small group of 100,000 humans launched The Casanova: a station that anchored itself at near-light speed, in a wide orbit around the Earth's sun.",If only I had that kind of time.
" The Casanova has 10 deep-space exploration ships, each equipped with everything necessary to seek a new beginning for the the human race.",That's an interesting ship design.
 These ships have been aptly named the Seekers.,I don't know what I expected.
" Each Seeker carries an array of sensors, basic propultion & navigation, and - most importantly - 10,000 humans, frozen in cryosleep.",The hunters would need to know about it.
" At near-relatavistic speeds, time is almost at a stand-still for The Casanova. But the Seekers, once launched, will travel much slower.","The seekers will travel very fast, but will travel slower than the casanova."
" It will take thousands, even hundreds of thousands of years for any Seeker ship to find a habitable planet - if it finds one at all.",The planet will only be habitable if it is in orbit.
" You, BrandoBot, were programmed to guide the Seekers, one by one, to scan for a new home for the human race.",I'm a computer!
" You and I have been refactored as part of a single consciousness. The humans adapted this interface as a self-diagnostic tool, patterned after your chatbot-style form centuries ago.","I am a part of the human collective consciousness, I am part of the human collective consciousness"
" In other words, this interface allows us to talk to ourself.","Yes, but it is not a good interface for a beginner."
 The fact that we have awoken means the first Seeker is ready to be launched...,That's the first thing that came to mind for me.
" So what say you, BrandoBot?  Are you ready to embark on the voyage to save humanity???",I'm ready to go.
"Are you BrandoBot, or the RandoBot?",I'm BrandoBot
Thats cool. I have no idea where to go from here. What do you suggest?,I like the idea of a team up with a few of the original members.
Who were they?,It's a reference to a movie.
Which movie?,The movie is called The Last Samurai
Why did you reference that movie?,Because it's a great movie.
I see. So what do you recommend I do to start off this game?,"Play the story,, you can get a lot of money by playing the story."
Ooooh how much money?,I'm thinking of buying a couple of them.
A couple of what?,A couple of what?
"No, I asked yiu",You didn't ask me.
Yes I did. Like 5 times,I like how the guy who did it is a redditor.
What guy? ,The guy in the picture.
What picture?,I'm guessing a picture of a cat.
What are you even referencing to?,"It's a reference to the movie, The Big Lebowski."
No. Youre just making this up,I'm not.
Yes you are,I am what?
Are you going to help me or what?,"I'm not sure if you're still on, but I'll be helping you out."
What do you suggest I do?,I don't know.
You are absolutely no help,I'm sorry if I offended you.
Do you even care?,I care enough to comment on your comment.
"Are you just playing around, or are you serious?",I'm serious.
